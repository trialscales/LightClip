LightClip v1.2 User Guide (English)
===================================

1. When LightClip starts, it stays in the system tray and listens to clipboard changes.
2. The main window contains two tabs:
   - Clipboard: shows clipboard history.
   - Templates: manage frequently used text snippets.
3. Use the search box and type filter at the top to quickly locate past entries.
4. For clipboard entries, you can pin, delete, copy back to clipboard, or clear history (keeping pinned items).
5. On the Templates tab, you can add / edit / delete templates, or copy a template's content to clipboard and paste it elsewhere.
6. Templates can be bound to indices 1~9, which are used with global hotkeys Ctrl+Shift+1..9.

Settings:
- Via the "Settings" menu, you can adjust:
  - Interface language (Traditional Chinese / English)
  - UI theme (Light / Dark)
  - Icon theme (Light / Dark icon)
  - Maximum number of history entries.

About:
- Via the "About" menu you can check the current version and a short description.

Closing the main window will not quit the app; it will minimize to tray. To fully exit, right-click the tray icon and choose "Quit".
